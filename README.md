Weather App
About The Project
This Weather App is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to display weather forecasts for various locations.
It was created as a personal project to learn about calling APIs, working with API documentation, and integrating backend data with a frontend interface.
The application utilizes the Visual Crossing Weather API to fetch comprehensive weather data and displays it in an easily understandable format.
